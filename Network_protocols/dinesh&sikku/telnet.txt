== Problem:

* How to log into another computer from one's own computer connected to same network? 

== Telnet:

* Telnet is a protocol used on the Internet or Local Area Networks to provide a bidirectional,
interactive, text-oriented communication facility using a virtual terminal connection.

* Developed in 1969.

* Telnet works over TCP/IP protocol and is connection oriented.

* Telnet is mainly designed for remote login to another computer.

== Telnet Connection:

== TCP Sessions and Client/Server Communication:

* Interactive communication of data and commands between client and server over a prolonged period of time called session.
* Telnet listens at port 23.

== How it works?

. Connection is established between client and server.
. In client program, Remote user enters the commands.
. Data is transmitted over network via TCP 1 byte at a time.
. Server program receives the command and executes command in its own terminal.
. Then output is send back via network by server.
. Client receives output and prints it.

== Problems in sending and receiving data:
* How data is sent
* Different character set
* Number of characters per line
* Lines per screen

== Network Virtual Terminal

* Imaginary terminal for universal communication in devices.
* NVT defines a set of rules for how information is formatted and sent,
such as character set, line termination.

=== How NVT works

* In Telnet Client converts data from Native language to NVT language.
* Then data is send over Network as NVT language.
* Server converts from NVT to native language and executes it.

== Telnet Protocol Commands:

* Input that a user enters at a terminal takes the form of data and commands.
* Then sent to the application program.
* Computer system provide a means by which a user can instruct the terminal to send certain commands
that control how the terminal itself operates, and how it interacts with the computer to which it is connected.
** For E.g Interrupt a process.

== Telnet to access other servers:
* Telnet NVT representation is used by a variety of other protocols such as SMTP, FTP and HTTP.
* Telnet client can allow us to access other application servers.
* Application servers port number must be specified to connect to the server.
* Based on that particular server, commands are given.

== Thankyou
