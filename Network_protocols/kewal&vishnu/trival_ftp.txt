= *Trivial File Transfer Protocol*
- By : Vishnu and Kewal

== *Uses*

image::digram.png[length = "300", width = "1000"]

* TFTP is used in situations where all the features of a full file transfer protocol like FTP are not needed
* TFTP is mainly used during device bootstrap process for downloading device OS/firmware and configuration files
* It is used along with boot protocols like DHCP to initialize devices

== *TFTP Services*

|===
|*Provides :-*
|Faster file transfer, as it uses UDP as the transport layer protocol
|Lesser Code size or foot print
|Netascii and Octet modes of file transfer
|===

|===
|*Doesn't provides :-*
|Does not provide authentication
|Does not support a rich set of user interface commands
|===

== *Operation*
* TFTP servers waits on the well known UDP port number 69.
* The TFTP client then sends a read request (RRQ) to the server if it wants to get a file
or sends a write request (WRQ) if it wants to transfer a file onto the server.
* TFTP splits a file, to be transferred, into blocks of size 512 bytes and transfers it as TFTP DATA messages.
Each TFTP DATA block is numbered and carried inside separate UDP messages.
* The last block of a file is always sent with a size lesser than 512. When the peer receives a block with size less than 512 bytes,
it treats that block as the last block of the file that is being transferred.
