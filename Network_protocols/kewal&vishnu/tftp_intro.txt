TFTP is a simple light weight application layer file transfer protocol, used for transferring  files over the network.

TFTP was first standardized in 1981 and the current specification for the protocol can be found in RFC 1350.

Uses:-
> TFTP is used in situations where all the features of a full file transfer protocol like FTP are not needed
> TFTP is mainly used during device bootstrap process for downloading device OS/firmware and configuration files
> It is used along with boot protocols like DHCP to initialize devices

TFTP provides:-
> Faster file transfer, as it uses UDP as the transport layer protocol
> Lesser Code size or foot print
> Ascii and binary modes of file transfer

TFTP does not provide:-
> Does not provide authentication
> Does not support a rich set of user interface commands

Operation:-
> TFTP servers waits on the well known UDP port number 69.
> The TFTP client then sends a read request (RRQ) to the server if it wants to get a file or sends a write request (WRQ) if it wants to transfer a file onto the server.
> TFTP splits a file, to be transferred, into blocks of size 512 bytes and transfers it as TFTP DATA messages. Each TFTP DATA block is numbered and carried inside separate UDP messages.
> The last block of a file is always sent with a size lesser than 512. When the peer receives a block with size less than 512 bytes, it treats that block as the last block of the file that is being transferred.

TFTP messages:-
RRQ: Request to read a file
WRQ: Request to write a file
DATA: Contains a block of file data
ACK: Used by peer to acknowledge each block of DATA
ERROR: Used by peer to indicate erroneous operations
